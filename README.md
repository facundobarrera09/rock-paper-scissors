Simple Rock-Paper-Scissors Game against the Computer - The Odin Project

This project consists on a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer through the devtools command line.

The Landing Page is meant to put to practise what I have leart during the course.

This includes:
    - JS: variables, constants, conditionals, loops, functions.
    - Functions: parameters, return values, anonymous functions, arrow functions.
    - Problem solving: identifying the problem, planning, and dividing to conquer.
    - Debbugging: Recognizing errors, correcting logic and sintactic errors.
